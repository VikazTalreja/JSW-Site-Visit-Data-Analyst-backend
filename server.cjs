GP 0.30 for Samsung back panel application
We have customer end rejection of around 4% every month
Even the material consumed by Samsung is not perfectly okay for the application, they're somehow managing to use by applying tape

There is a possibility of losing out entire 450 MT to AMNS for this application
Hence, we need to explore possibility of developing an improved grade
TPR team has already tried using an improved grade HR but still did not work
